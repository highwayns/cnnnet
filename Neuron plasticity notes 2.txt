In order to perform the synapse plasticity operation we need the following parameters:
 - NeuronDendricTreeRange - the range within the soma forms synapses to other neurons
 
 - NeuronActivityHistoryLength - For how many iterations do we hold the neuronal activity. This means that only the last 'NeuronActivityHistoryLength'
								 iterations are going to be used in order to determine if a neuron fires.
								 
 - NeuronActivityIdleIterations - after how many iterations is the neuron allowed to fire again.
								- This is also used in order to decrease the strength of the synapses that fire during this period

 - NeuronIsActiveMinimumActivityScore - the minimum activity score required for a neuron to activate
 
 - NeuronSynapseStrengthChangeAmount - the amount the the synapse strength should change due to synaptic plasticity (up or down).
 
 - IterationsSinceLastActivation - calculated field - holds the number of iterations performed since the last activation
 
	Observation: The parameters 'NeuronActivityHistoryLength' and 'NeuronActivityIdleIterations' are used to perform STDP (Spike-timing-dependent plasticity)

Implementation steps:

 1. Add synapses to new neurons within the dendric tree range (parameter 'NeuronDendricTreeRange').
 2. If IterationsSinceLastActivation >= NeuronActivityIdleIterations (the neuron is capable of activation)
	- True - Calculate ActivityScore based on active synapses count from the last 'NeuronActivityHistoryLength' iterations
		IF ActivityScore >= NeuronIsActiveMinimumActivityScore
			- True - Set neuron active
				   - Increase the strength of the synapses that helped the neuron activate
				   - clean the activation history
			- 




 - Add new synapses
 - Decay current activity
 - Find the previously active synapses
 - Increase current neuron activity with the synapses found earlier
 - Increase strength for the synapses that contributed to a spike





 Synapse strength adjustment
 1. if neuron fires 
	- increase the strength of the synapses that contributed to the spike (during NeuronActivityHistoryLength)
	- decrease the strength of synapses that fire after the spike (during NeuronActivityIdleIterations)
 2. if neuron does NOT fire
	- increase the strength of every synapse that fires

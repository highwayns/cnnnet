 - Add new synapses
 - Decay current activity
 - Find the previously active synapses
 - Increase current neuron activity with the synapses found earlier
 - Increase strength for the synapses that contributed to a spike





 Synapse strength adjustment
 1. if neuron fires 
	- increase the strength of the synapses that contributed to the spike (during NeuronActivityHistoryLength)
	- decrease the strength of synapses that fire after the spike (during NeuronActivityIdleIterations)
 2. if neuron does NOT fire
	- increase the strength of every synapse that fires
